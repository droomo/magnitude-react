# Magnitude

Magnitude project frontend, dedicated to my graduate work, originated as a fork of
[`django-rect`](https://git.droomo.com/moon/droomo-react/-/tags/last_mixed_version) 
from which all irrelevant code has been removed.

Different branches represent different experiments in the graduation project, 
among which two branches containing `vr` have created immersive VR scenes using the `webxr` protocol.

In past commits, you might also find code related to the study of digital sensation, as well as previous coursework, etc.

For security reasons, the backend code of this project has not been made public.

Feel free to contact me if you need the backend code for research purposes.
